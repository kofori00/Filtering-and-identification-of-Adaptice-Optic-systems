# Filtering-and-identification-of-Adaptice-Optic-systems
 The goal is to use the several filtering and identification methods to solve control problems  that  arise  in  adaptive  optics  (AO)  system.   It  covers  weighted  least  squares,  Kalman   ltering,Vector-  Auto-Regressive  modeling  and  stochastic  subspace  identi catio
